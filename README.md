# Parametric Whistle Talk

These are files relating to a talk I gave at Lancaster and Morecambe Makers about 3 ways to model a referee whistle in FreeCAD.

The idea of the talk was:

  * to give beginners an idea of how to go about modelling a real object in a 3D design program.
  * to show that there is usually more than one way to go about modelling any given object.
  * to give a basic introduction to how to use the FreeCAD 3D design program.

I have included the Libre Office presentation file, as well as all the FreeCAD projects that I showed during the talk.
